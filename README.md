# Challenges Coding Exercise Frontend

### Problem Statement

Build a small application that should be able to: 

- Search for Pokemon by text through use of a search bar.
- Filter Pokemon by type using a dropdown.
- Add and remove a Pokemon to and from your Favorites by clicking the heart icon.
- Use tabs to switch between `All` Pokemon and `Favorite` Pokemon views.
- Change the view from either a grid or list.
- View Pokemon details using a `/:name` route.
- Clicking on a Pokemon image or name should navigate to the above route to view the Pokemon details.
- On the Pokemon details page, have a speaker icon that, when clicked, plays the sound of that Pokemon.

In addition to the above features, below are some optional features that we'd love to see at least one of:
- Infinitely scrolled or paginated list to handle on-demand data-fetching for the long list of Pokemon.
- Add a quick view button on the Pokemon list items that shows a modal with more information of the Pokemon.
- Add toast notifications to show success or error messages when adding or removing a Pokemon to and from your Favorites.
